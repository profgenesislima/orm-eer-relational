# Translating Extended Entity-Relationship to Relational Model using the Object-Relational Mapping
EER to Relational translation through Object Relational Mapping using JPA
## About  
The project's goal was to translate the company entity-relationship sample model present in Navathe's book Fundamentals of Database Systems into a Relational model using Java Persistence API.
The intention was to show to an undergraduate audience how to translate from Entity-Relationship to Relational Model using the ORM and the undesirable effects of doing so wrongly.
