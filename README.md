# Translating Extended Entity-Relationship to Relational Model using the Object-Relational Mapping
EER to Relational translation through Object Relational Mapping using JPA
## About  
The project's goal was to translate the company entity relationship sample model present in the  Navathe's book Fundamentals of Database Systems into Relational model using Java Persistence API.
The intention was to show to an undergraduate audience how to translate from Entity-Relationship to Relational Model using the ORM and the undesireble effects of to do so
wrongly.
